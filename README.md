# Digit-URL-Helper

A simple and basic programme to making opening URLs from the popular Indian mag "[Digit](https://geek.digit.in/)" easier. It can be used in two modes: 

1.  Month-year-number Method: Specify the month, year of the mag's publication, and just the url no. printed at the end.
2. Suffix method: Just specify the end of the url given in the mag. (EX. in https://digit.in/aug20-34,  you just have to enter aug20-34)

After entering the input, user is taken to the desired url.
